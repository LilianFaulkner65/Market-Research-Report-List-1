<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Gas Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contacting Gas Seal</li><li>Non-Contacting Gas Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dry gas mechanical seals market is primarily divided into two types: contacting gas seals and non-contacting gas seals. Contacting gas seals operate with physical contact between seal components, providing reliable sealing at the cost of increased wear and energy consumption. In contrast, non-contacting gas seals avoid direct contact, utilizing a controlled gas film for sealing, which minimizes wear and enhances efficiency. This distinction affects their application in industries such as oil and gas, chemical processing, and power generation.</p></p>
