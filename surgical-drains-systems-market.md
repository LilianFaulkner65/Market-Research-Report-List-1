<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drains Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical drains systems market consists of passive and active drains, each serving distinct functions. Passive drains rely on gravity, allowing fluid to flow from the surgical site into a collection bag without additional pressure, commonly used for minor surgeries. Active drains, on the other hand, utilize suction to facilitate fluid removal, providing better control and preventing fluid accumulation, making them ideal for more complex procedures. Both types play crucial roles in patient recovery and infection prevention post-surgery.</p></p>
