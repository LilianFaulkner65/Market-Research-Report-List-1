<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Trucks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Trucks</li><li>LNG Trucks</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The natural gas trucks market is primarily divided into two types: CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) trucks and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) trucks. CNG trucks are designed for short to medium distances, utilizing compressed gas stored at high pressures, making them suitable for urban environments and fleet operations. In contrast, LNG trucks are intended for long-haul transport, using liquefied gas stored at cryogenic temperatures, which allows for greater energy density and longer ranges. Both types contribute to reducing emissions and dependence on diesel fuel.</p></p>
