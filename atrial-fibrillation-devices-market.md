<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The atrial fibrillation devices market encompasses various treatment options, notably catheter ablation and maze surgery. Catheter ablation involves using catheters to target and destroy faulty electrical pathways in the heart, restoring normal rhythm. It is minimally invasive and often preferred for its short recovery time. Maze surgery, on the other hand, is a more invasive procedure that creates a maze-like pattern of scar tissue in the atria to disrupt erratic electrical impulses, effectively managing atrial fibrillation. Both techniques significantly improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
