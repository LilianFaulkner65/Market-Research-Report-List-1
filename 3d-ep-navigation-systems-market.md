<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D EP Navigation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contact Mapping Navigation System</li><li>Contact Mapping Navigation System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D EP (Electrophysiology) Navigation Systems market features two main types: non-contact and contact mapping navigation systems. Non-contact mapping systems utilize a catheter that captures electrical signals without direct contact with the heart tissue, allowing for more efficient data collection over larger areas. In contrast, contact mapping systems rely on physical contact with the heart to gather precise voltage information but may require more time and present a higher risk of tissue damage. Both systems enhance cardiac procedure accuracy and safety.</p></p>
