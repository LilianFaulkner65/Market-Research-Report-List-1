<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neutral density Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reflective Type</li><li>Reflective Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neutral density (ND) filters are used to reduce the intensity of light entering a camera lens without altering color balance. The market is divided into two primary types: non-reflective and reflective. Non-reflective ND filters, typically made from glass or optical resin, absorb light uniformly across wavelengths, ideal for photography and videography. Reflective ND filters, on the other hand, use coatings that reflect certain wavelengths to reduce light intensity, often employed in specific cinematographic applications. Both types enhance creative control in various lighting conditions.</p></p>
