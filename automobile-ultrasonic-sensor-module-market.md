<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Ultrasonic Sensor Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Type</li><li>Transmission Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automobile ultrasonic sensor module market comprises primarily two types: reflective and transmission sensors. Reflective type sensors emit ultrasonic waves that bounce off nearby objects and return to the sensor, measuring distance based on the time taken for the echo. Transmission type sensors, on the other hand, consist of a transmitter and receiver placed opposite each other, continuously monitoring the space between them. Both types enhance vehicle safety by aiding in obstacle detection, parking assistance, and collision avoidance systems.</p></p>
