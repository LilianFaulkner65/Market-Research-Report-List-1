<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) Shunt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Pressure Valves</li><li>Variable Pressure Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt market is categorized into two main types: fixed pressure valves and variable pressure valves. Fixed pressure valves maintain a constant pressure level, allowing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage at a set rate, which simplifies management for healthcare providers. In contrast, variable pressure valves can adjust the pressure threshold based on patient needs or specific conditions, offering greater adaptability for varying intracranial pressure scenarios. Both types are essential for effective treatment of hydrocephalus.</p></p>
