<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resin Coated Proppant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Curable Resin-Coated Proppant</li><li>Precured Resin-Coated Proppant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Resin-Coated Proppant (RCP) market includes two main types: Curable Resin-Coated Proppant and Precured Resin-Coated Proppant. Curable RCP features a resin coating that hardens under downhole conditions, enhancing proppant strength and preventing flowback. Precured RCP has a fully cured resin coating before use, offering immediate durability and resistance to crushing. Both types improve hydraulic fracturing efficiency by maintaining fracture conductivity, but curable RCP adapts to well conditions, while precured RCP provides consistent performance in high-stress environments.</p></p>
