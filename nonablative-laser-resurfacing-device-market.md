<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nonablative Laser Resurfacing Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonablative Fractionated Lasers</li><li>Nonablative Nonfractionated Lasers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nonablative laser resurfacing device market consists primarily of two types: nonablative fractionated lasers and nonablative nonfractionated lasers. Nonablative fractionated lasers target specific skin areas, creating microscopic columns of thermal injury, which stimulates collagen production while preserving surrounding tissue. This results in less downtime and quicker recovery. Nonablative nonfractionated lasers, on the other hand, deliver uniform energy across the skin without creating fractional injuries, making them suitable for overall skin texture improvement with minimal discomfort and recovery time.</p></p>
